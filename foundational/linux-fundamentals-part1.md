# Room: Linux Fundamentals Part 1

## 🎯 Objective
Learn the basics of Linux, including navigating the file system, using commands, and understanding permissions.

---

## 🔎 Enumeration
- Explored the Linux file system structure (`/home`, `/etc`, `/var`).
- Practiced navigation commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`.
- Learned how to view file contents with `cat`, `less`, and `head/tail`.

---

## 💥 Exploitation (Learning Focus)
- Practiced creating and editing files with `touch`, `nano`, and `vim`.
- Used `chmod` to change file permissions.
- Learned how to identify user roles and groups with `whoami` and `groups`.

---

## 🔼 Privilege Escalation (Conceptual)
- Introduction to the concept of root vs. standard users.
- Learned how `sudo` allows privilege escalation for authorized users.
- Practiced safe use of elevated commands.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Linux is the backbone of most cybersecurity labs and servers.
- Navigation and file manipulation are essential skills for both red and blue team work.
- Permissions and user roles are critical for security — misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.
- Comfort with the command line builds confidence for more advanced labs.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Practiced
- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `nano`, `vim`
- `chmod`, `sudo`, `whoami`
