# Module: Metasploit

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to use the Metasploit Framework for penetration testing, exploitation, and post‑exploitation.

---

## Metasploit: Introduction
- Explored the basics of the Metasploit Framework.
- Learned how to launch `msfconsole` and navigate modules.
- Understood the different module types:
  - Auxiliary (scanning, fuzzing)
  - Exploit (attack delivery)
  - Payload (code execution)
- Ran a first exploit against a vulnerable target.

---

## Metasploit: Exploitation
- Practiced scanning and identifying vulnerabilities.
- Used exploit modules to gain access to systems.
- Delivered payloads to establish sessions.
- Learned how attackers chain exploits with payloads for control.

---

## Metasploit: Meterpreter
- Deep dive into the Meterpreter payload.
- Practiced in‑memory execution and stealth techniques.
- Explored persistence and privilege escalation.
- Used post‑exploitation modules for:
  - File system navigation
  - Password dumping
  - Network pivoting

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Metasploit is a powerful framework for offensive security testing.
- Exploitation requires careful enumeration and module selection.
- Meterpreter provides advanced post‑exploitation capabilities.
- Understanding Metasploit helps defenders anticipate attacker techniques.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Commands Practiced
- `msfconsole`
- `search` (finding modules)
- `use` (loading modules)
- `set` (configuring options)
- `exploit` (running attacks)
- Meterpreter commands (`sysinfo`, `getuid`, `hashdump`, `shell`)
