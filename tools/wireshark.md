# Module: Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.

---

## Wireshark: Introduction
- Learned how to start packet captures.
- Explored the Wireshark interface (packet list, details, bytes).
- Practiced basic display filters (e.g., `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`).

---

## Wireshark: Traffic Analysis
- Analyzed HTTP requests and responses.
- Explored DNS queries and responses.
- Studied TCP handshakes and UDP traffic.
- Learned how attackers can be detected through abnormal traffic patterns.

---

## Wireshark: Advanced
- Built complex filters to isolate suspicious traffic.
- Used Wireshark for troubleshooting latency and dropped packets.
- Practiced identifying malicious activity (e.g., beaconing, exfiltration).
- Learned how defenders use Wireshark in SOC investigations.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Wireshark is essential for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity.
- Filters make traffic analysis efficient and precise.
- Understanding protocols helps detect anomalies and attacks.
- Packet analysis is a core skill for SOC analysts and penetration testers.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Filters Practiced
- Capture filters vs. display filters
- Common filters: `http`, `dns`, `tcp.port == 80`
- Exporting packet captures for deeper analysis
